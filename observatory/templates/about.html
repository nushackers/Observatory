            <p>Treehouse is the central project dashboard for NUS Hackers. We use this site to share knowledge, links, track project updates, and coordinate programing efforts. Think of Treehouse as a watchtower for all activity across the NUS Hackers.</p>
            <p>The reason for Treehouse's existence is so that we can <em>learn more</em> from each other's posts, comments and hacks.</p>

            <h3>About NUS Hackers </h3>
            <p>NUS Hackers is a student-run organization committed to the spread of hacker culture & free/open-source software at the National University of Singapore. We provide a support system for hackers in NUS who are currently building things (be it for charity, business or pleasure). We also hold workshops, run hackfests, and maintain open source code for the NUS community. More information at <a href="http://nushackers.org/about">http://nushackers.org/about</a>.</p>
